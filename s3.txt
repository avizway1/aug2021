S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

Object based storage :  We cannot install/run any applications/os. : Dropbox / GDrive 
--> Designed to flat files.

Block based storage : Designed to run OS, We can install/run applications.. : EBS, Instance store volumes. : EC2 
Storage over the network : Storage runs over the network and it can be mounted to multiple devices. : EFS, FSx : EC2


--> Designed to store objects. We can store any flat files.
--> We store data in BUCKETS. 
--> Bucket names should be unique across the globe. 
--> Defualtly, we can create 100 buckets, This is a soft limit. 
--> We can store unlimited data in a bucket.
--> No Pre-provisioning required.
--> Bucket naming limitations
	--> Min char 3, Max 63 char length
	--> Bucket name should be in small , and numeric
	--> Bucket name should not start with .
	--> Should not end with . , No adjesent ..
	--> Bucket name should not resemble IP address format. (192.168.100.1)

--> We can upload objects to this buckets.
--> Min obj size : 0 bytes.. Max Obj size: 5 TB
--> S3 is a global service. Doesn't required region selection.
--> While creating we need to choose the region. Data physically resides at this regions AZs. 

https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)

Virtual paths won't work if we have . in bucket names.

Block Public Access settings for this account : Account Level Blocking
Block public access (bucket settings) : Bucket level Blocking
--> We should make an object public, then only Object URLs works.

S3 Free Tier ELigibility : 
5 GB Standard Storage
--> 2000 PUT / 20,000 GET

Avai : 99.9 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

RRS : Redused Redundancy Storage : Not Recommanded : Less durability.. 
Durability : 99.99%, As we have less durability we have high chances to loss the data when compared to another storage classes.


S3 Pricing : 
--> How much data we are storing.
--> How many GET/PUT operations (uploads/downloaded object count)
--> Data retrivals

Glacier data retrival : 
Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.

_________

Version : AWS maintains multiple copies in s3 bucket. 
--> Defaultly versioning will be in Suspended state.
--> When versioning is enabled, If we delete an object

Versioning : HIDE
--> We will get a Delete Marker. 
--> TO get object back / undo delete, Delete the delete marker.

Versioning : SHOW
--> If we delete an object, it deletes permanently.

Life Cycle Management Rule : 

S3 Standard --> StandardIA --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Delete


CRR / SRR : 
--> Source bucket and destination bucket must be enabled with versioning. 
--> Existing objects will not replicate to the destination bucket.
--> All future / subsequent uplods will replicate to destination bucket. 

RTC : Replication time control : Data replicates to destination bucket with in 15 Min. (99.99% of the data) : COST US

______

Server access logging : enable logging on bucket.

Cloudtrail : Data events : It allow us to log all s3 activities (Current buckets and future buckets).

--> In-Transit Encryption : 
	SSL (Secure socket layer) / TLS (Transport layer secure)

--> SSE (Server Side Encryption) / At-rest : 

SSE-S3 : S3 platform generates and manages the key material. whoever have valid access on S3 platform can decrypt/view the data. (An encryption key that Amazon S3 creates, manages, and uses for you).

SSE-KMS : Key Management Service : 
	KMS (AWS managed keys) (aws/s3) DMK(Default Master Key) : KMS Service generates and manages the key material. whoever have valid access on S3 platform can decrypt/view the data. We cannot delete these keys. 
	 CMK (Customer managed keys) : KMS Service generates and manages the keymaterial.
Along with S3 platform, the IAM user need to have valid permissions on ENCRYPTION KEY also. NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY.
	SSE-C (Customer Provided Key): Customer generates and upload the key material to KMS and KMS uses this key material to encrypt/decrypt the data. CUstomer can change the key material at any time. NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY.

CSE (Client Side Encryption) : Before uploading data to s3 platform, we can use our own software/applications to encrypt the data. That encryptrd data we can send to s3. AWS is not completely responsible for this mechanism.


Encryption key generation : 
--> Provide alias/name.
--> CHoose type (Symmetric/asymetric) : Symmetric
Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations
Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations

--> key administrative permissions : Who can administrate this key. : Avinash_T
--> key usage permissions : Who can use this key to decrypt the data : Avinash_T

KMS Keys, we cannot delete immedeatly. We need to schedule key deletion (Min: 7 Days, Max: 31 Days)

________
Billing alarm configurtion : 

--> Billing dashboard --> Billing preferences --> Enable "Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts"
--> Billing dashboard --> Billing preferences --> Enable "Receive Billing Alerts"

______

Object Lock : 
--> Versioning must be enabled.
Permanently allows objects in this bucket to be locked. Additional Object Lock configuration is required in bucket details after bucket creation to protect objects in this bucket from being deleted or overwritten.

Governance : Users with specific IAM permissions can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

Compliance : No users can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

____________________________________
Requester pays : the requester pays for requests and data transfer costs, and anonymous access to this bucket is disabled. Instead of bucket owner data requester need to pay for the data transfer & request.
--> Anonomus access disables once we enable this feature.

______

S3 Static Website hosting : Fixed website/webpages.
--> DOmain name should be same as Bucket Name. (Route53)
--> Data should be made Public Read. 

We can access webiste using bucket website endpoint 
--> http://avinash.co.in.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

Http status codes : 

2XX --> OK/SUCCESS
3XX --> Redirection errors

IAMUser-1 : S3FullAccess : Okay to have full access on all resources.
IAMUser-2 : S3FullAccess : Restrict this user to Delete "avinash.bucket" and restrict "PUT" on "avinash.bucket".

arn : Amazon Resource Name

Effect : ALLOW / DENY : DENY

Principal : For what user/group you want to allow/deny : arn:aws:iam::501170964283:user/user2

Bucket Level : arn:aws:s3:::avinash.bucket
Object level : arn:aws:s3:::avinash.bucket/*


Task 1 : IAMuser should have access to only one s3 bucket. (Create an IAM policy to list all the bucket, but the iam user should work in only one bucket allocated to him).



____________________

Cloudwatch : Monitoring service. We can create alarms, Graphs based on resource metrics. 

Storage Class Analysis : Analyze storage access patterns to help you decide when to transition objects to the appropriate storage class.

Inventory configurations : We will get all the objects list with properties.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ManageCorsUsing.html

Access control list (ACL) : Grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts.
 
--> By using 3rd party applications.. Using CLI.. 

Non_Compliant operation : We never ever should make a bucket public in org.

_______

Performance : 

--> Increase the randomness in object names.
--> Use the prefixes. 

--> 3500 PUT/Sec.. 5500 GET/Sec.. If we are directly storing all data in s3 platform.

In S3, Perfix place imp role. /prefix we will get 3500 put & 5500 get operations.

Req: 35,000 PUT.. --> Create 10 folders and upload data simumtaniously. 

________________________________________________________________________________________

D: 02/09/2021

Consistancy Mechanism : 

Read after write Consistency for PUT of new objects. (If we upload any object, it will be available immedeatly without any delay)
Eventual Consistency overwrite of Put objects and Delete objects. (If any object is overwritten/deleted, at same time if any request is generated slight chances are there to get the deleted data/outdated data)
