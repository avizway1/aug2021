VPC : Virtual Private Cloud : 

Public IP : Unique across the globe. : 
Private IP : WOrks with in network. Unique with in the network. : 

IPv4 : 32 bit : 2^32 : 
IPv6 : 128 bit : 2^128 : 

Class A : 0.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255	
Class B : 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255

Class D : 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255	--> Broadcost/multicasting
Class E : 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255	--> R&D

Private IP Ranges From Each Class : Free to use in any network. 

Class A : 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
Class B : 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.0.0
Class C : 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

Network : group of interconnected/communi devices.
Host : Device with in network

Based on How many Networks you gonna create, Each network contains how many hosts..??
Class A : N.H.H.H		: 127 N/w, Each network 16M hosts
Class B : N.N.H.H		: 16,000 N/w, Each n/w 65k hosts
Class C : N.N.N.H		: 2M Networks, Each n/w supports 256 hosts

In regular networks, 2 IPs are reserved.. (Network ID/1st IP and Broadcost ID/Last IP)

AWS Reservs 5 IPs for every subnet we create.. 
--> 2 Regular network
--> 2 for DNS Servers
--> 1 Future use

In AWS, It supports Min /28, Max /16 CIDR/subnets.

When we calculating Usable IPs, We need to do -5.

_________

CIDR : Classless InterDomain Routing : 
--> How big network we required. 
--> How many instances/ resources, we gonna launch. (predict)


Public Subnet : Internet facing subnet.. :
Private Subnet : Non-Internet facing subnet.. : 

How big VPC we required.?				Ans : /17 (32763 Usable IPs)
How many subnets we required within the VPC..?		Ans : 2
How many public SUbnets required within vpc..?		Ans : 1
How many private SUbnets required within vpc.?		Ans : 1
Are you going to create any subnets in future.?		Ans : Yes (Have some IPs for future use).


Public SUbnet : Resources we launch here can access internt, and it can be accesable over internet.

Private Subnet : Resources we launch here cannot access over the internet. If we need internet for Private subnet resources we need to configure NAT.

Every region have a Default VPC. It uses Class B IP ranges (172.16.0.0 - 172.31.0.0)
--> If we delete Default VPC, We can create again (Actions --> create defualt vpc). 
--> If we have any resources in VPC, It won;t allow us to delete it.

Step 1 : Create a VPC.
	VPC Name : CustomVPC		VPC CIDR : 192.168.0.0/17

Step 2 : Create Subnets within CustomVPC. 

Name : Public Subnet : ap-south-1a : 192.168.0.0/28
Name : Private SUbnet : ap-south-1b : 192.168.0.32/27

Step 3 : Create an Internet Gateway and associate with CustomVPC.
--> One VPC can contains one IGW.

Step 4 : Create RouteTables and Associate appropriate Subnets, add required routes.

PublicRoute : We need to associate InternetGateway. 
PrivateRoute without internet : Don't add IGW/NAT.
PrivateRoute With Intenet : Create NAT Gateway and add NAT Gateway.

--> PublicRoute : Go to SUbnet Association and choose "Public SUbnet". Navigate to Routes and add a route via IGW. 	 (0.0.0.0/0 --> IGW)

--> PrivateRoute : Go to SUbnet Association and choose "Private SUbnet".

Step 5 (Optional) : Navigate to Subnets, Choose "Public SUbnet", Actions, "Modify auto assign public ip settings", Enable.


JUMP Server / Bastian Host : Is a Dedicated EC2 instance, Runs in CustomVPC PUblicSUbnet and can be used to connect to all the "Private Subnet" ec2 instances.


___________

Task : Create a VPC with 4 Subnets. (2 Public SUbnets and 2 Private Subnets)
2 Public SUbnets (ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b)
2 Private SUbnets (ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b)

Task 2 : draw.io website and design this diagram.

VPC NAT Gateway (No FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY): Is designed to provide Internet to private Subnet resources. NAT always runs in custom VPCs public subnet. We need to generate an EIP (Elastic IP). 

Private subnet ec2 instances want to access something from internet / endpoint hosted over the internet / patching purpose it needs internet. 

--> Make sure your edit PrivateRoute, and add an entry with 0.0.0.0/0 via NAT gateway.

____

NAT Instance : Now a days we are not using it.  It is an ec2 instance runs in custom vpcs public subnet, provides internet to private subnet resources.  (TEST IT)

--> We need to takes  care about the Security groups.
--> Source/destination check must be disabled.

--> Make sure your edit PrivateRoute, and add an entry with 0.0.0.0/0 via NAT Instance.
______________________

Enable Logging on VPC : 
Flow Logs: We can enable flowlogs at 
--> VPC Level
--> Subnet Level
--> Instance Level

We can choose destination as 1. S3 bucket 2. Cloudwatch Logs groups.

___

NACL : Network Access Control List : We can allow/deny traffic at Subnet level/AZ level using this NACLs.
--> We need to takes care about the inbound rules and outbound rules.
--> one subnet can be member of one NACL at a time.

--> Default NACLs, : all subnets member of this. It allows all the traffic.
--> New NACLs won't allow any traffic, Defaultly deny everything.  

--> Ephemeral ports / Temporary ports need to opened in NACL. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html

--> Lowest rule number will have highest permissions.

VPC Peering : Allow us to enable communication between multiple VPCs. (Same region, DIff region, Diff AWS accout VPCs)

--> Requester VPC and Accepter VPC should not have same CIDR range.
--> VPC Peering is non transitive peering. 
--> Update both the VPCs route tables with Another VPC CIDR blocks via Peering connection. 

		Requester VPC			Accepeter VPC
VPC CIDR	192.168.0.0/17			172.31.0.0/16
VPC ID		vpc-0f473cce69e74566c		vpc-51dd1137
Region		ap-south-1			ap-southeast-1
ACC ID		501170964283			501170964283


8 Subnets in environment : 2 Public, 2 application (private), 2 Lambda (private), 2 Database/data (private)

______________________________________________________________________________________


Endpoints : Private Links : It provides private connectivity to the resources. If we have any requirement, s3 rwquests/dynamodb req should not flow over the internet. 

NAT Gateway Works with IPv4. 
If our VPC is configured to use IPv6, Instead of NAT Gateway, We use "Egress Only Internet Gateways".


Can we associate multiple CIDRs for our VPC.
Yes..
